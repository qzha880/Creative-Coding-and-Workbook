## Coding process
<img width="1440" alt="截屏2025-02-07 04 41 52" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bad2ecb-2991-4dfc-9896-9467f5f758d6" />

I added fonts by following the workshop 6 video. 
I create a function to clear the canvas and prepare for the next step
* Used rect to cover the area that I want to make blank
 `noStroke();
  rect(0, height -150, width, height);
  fill(0);`
* Hide the button ` button.hide(); `
